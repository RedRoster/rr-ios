We're releasing something big soon! It will allow people to follow you and thus hide your profile from people who aren't following you, because you don't want people following you IRL. Also, more people will be able to use RedRoster (wink wink). So prepare yourself.

But this is a brief update. In short:

- I added crash analytics so if your app crashed I can see how to fix it. So please try crashing your app.
- Removed your profile tab, because what was the point of that?
